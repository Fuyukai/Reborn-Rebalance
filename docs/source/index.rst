Reborn Rebalance
================

This is my rebalance mod for Pokémon Reborn. These docs also serve as a complete walkthrough
for the entire E19 game.

This currently rebalances the following:

- Pokémon species, based on several data sources

  * The base source for rebalances is Pokémon Blaze Black 2 Redux (v1.4.0) by Drayano and AphexCubed.
    This is used for the Generation 1-5 Pokémon.
  * Then, Pokémon Photonic Sun by Buffel Salt is used for the Generation 6-7 Pokémon.
  * Finally, my own tweaks are used on top of the base tweaks.

*This mod is built on top of and REQUIRES the All Gens Patch, v2.5.0a.*
