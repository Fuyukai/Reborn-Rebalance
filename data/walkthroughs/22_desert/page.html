        I hate this desert. I <i>HATE</i> this part of the game. This is where the game really
        starts to fall apart and it doesn't pick itself back up until around Victory Road.
        <br/><br/>
        I tried to interject less snarky comments up until now, but I genuinely fucking hate this
        desert.
    </div>

    <p>
        When you're ready, make your way to Grandview Station in the Peridot Ward. The left computer
        can be activated to get your ticket to the desert; then walk through the turnstile at the 
        top to get to the desert.
    </p>

    {{ ss("taka") }}
    
    <p>
        If you did <i>not</i> fight Taka at the Water Treatment Plant, then he will appear here and
        force you into a battle.
    </p>

    {{ trainer_battle_content("Taka", "Taka", 24) }}

    <p>
        From here, a very important choice opens up, which will determine your final game route.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let him follow you to complete the second to last task for the good route (if you're 
        intending to get it). In exchange for lugging around Hitler's repentant son, he'll heal you
        after every battle out here... and given that this area is fucking massive, that's a pretty
        nice bonus.
    </p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Mirage Tower</h2>

    <p>
        There's three major areas out here in the desert: the Scrapyard, the handful of caves, and
        the Mirage Tower. The tower is the most annoying one of the three, so let's get it out of
        the way now. It's a mandatory post-game area (for one of the worse quests...) too.
    </p>

    <details>
        <summary>Finding the Mirage Tower</summary>

        <p>
            By default, you can't actually get to the Mirage Tower as you're on the wrong map.
            The path to it doesn't spawn until you get teleported over to the right map. In order to
            get to the right map you need to activate four <i>oasises</i>, which are found in
            various corners of the map.
        </p>

        <p>
            Oh, and the order of the oasises is random! Surprise. This is how to find each one,
            but you'll need to specifically search all four areas to find it. If you're running
            the game from a console window, then it helpfully prints out the map IDs which you can
            cross-reference here.
        </p>

        {{ ss("indicator") }}
        <p>
            By this set of train tracks (to the right and upwards from your starting station) there
            is an indicator tower. If this exists, then the Mirage Tower has spawned; 
            <strong>do not</strong> activate any other oasises after it as it'll despawn and you'll
            have to go to all of them again.
        </p>

        <hr/>

        {{ ss("oasis1") }}
        <p class="has-text-centered"><i>This oasis is found on {{ mp(694, "Map 694") }}.</i></p>

        <p>
            The easiest way to do this is to start from the train station you spawned at. Hug
            the left cliff wall of the desert and keep going upwards until you find the first oasis;
            activate the Light Shard to change map.
        </p>

        {{ ss("oasis2") }}
        <p class="has-text-centered"><i>This oasis is found on {{ mp(705, "Map 705") }}.</i></p>

        <p>
            Similar to before, start at the train station you spawned at; go to the right cliff 
            wall and go down until you find the second oasis.
        </p>

        {{ ss("oasis3") }}
        <p class="has-text-centered"><i>This oasis is found on {{ mp(703, "Map 703") }}.</i></p>

        <p>
            This one can be found by hugging the right cliff wall and going upwards instead. 
            There's an Ace Trainer here too who gets vaporised when you switch map.
        </p>

        {{ ss("oasis4") }}
        <p class="has-text-centered"><i>This oasis is found on {{ mp(704, "Map 704") }}.</i></p>

        <p>
            This oasis is found literally one screen to the left of the train station you spawn
            at.
        </p>

        {{ ss("mirage") }}
        <p>
            After all of that, hug the right cliff wall of the desert and keep going up until you
            find an area with normal sand; if you go through and into the subarea you'll find
            the Mirage Tower.
        </p>
    </details>

    <p>
        After all of that work, you can enter the Mirage Tower. Ignore the puzzle and start smashing
        the back walls of the tower instead; the <i>very last</i> tile that you break will open up
        a hole to a secret area underneath. There's no puzzle here; just walk around to find some
        Generation 8 TMs as well as a {{ sp("MIMIKYU") }}.
    </p>

    <details>
        <summary>Solving the Mirage Tower</summary>

        {{ ss("mpuzzle1") }}

        <p>
            In this puzzle, both of the blocksd are linked together; but you can only move one.
            Your goal is to get both blocks into the lighter square to unlock the path to the next
            room. The first room is obviously trivial; once you solve it, it'll open the stairs to
            the next room. (Also, it exposes the map shenanigans by deleting all your broken glass.)
        </p>
        <hr/>

        {{ ss("mpuzzle2") }}

        <p>
            The shenanigans begin in the second floor with the goal square being on different
            tiles. Luckily, this one is relatively simple; move the block along the path of the red
            arrow then activate the block three times. Even if the block on the left side is stuck,
            the block on the right side will still move (and vice-versa). From there you can push
            both blocks into their positions.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        {{ ss("mpuzzle3") }}
        
        <p>
            (These are hard to draw arrows for.)
        </p>

        <p>
            This one is deceptively simple; the mirror images means that the left block can be 
            manuevered into its spot whilst getting the right block stuck. Move it in the same way
            as the red arrow, then manuver the right block by simply pressing on the left block
            whilst the left block is stuck in its spot.
        </p>

        <hr/>

        {{ ss("mpuzzle4") }}

        <p>
            First, manuever the block along the red arrow. Once it's stuck behind the block, you
            can repeatedly activate it to move the right block into position, which will get it
            stuck on the bottom row. Then, manuever the left block into position by only moving it
            <i>down</i>. 
        </p>

        <hr/>

        {{ ss("mpuzzle5") }}
        <p>
            There's no good way to represent this with arrows, so here's the steps for the fifth
            puzzle.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Move the block down one tile, right one tile, up one tile, and then all the way
                to the right to align it with the hole. (This one does havee an arrow.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Move the block down two spaces. The right-hand block should be two tiles from
                the left, and three tiles from the top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Move the block one tile to the right, and activate it again to move the right-hand
                block one tile to the right of the opening on the right side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Move the block one tile to the left to align it with the upper hole again. Both
                blocks should be aligned to the hole now; push the block down three times to
                align the right block with its spot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Move the block left one tile, and up one tile to align the left block with its
                spot. Both spots are the same distance away from the left edge with nothing blocking
                them; move the block all the way to the left edge, then push it into the spott.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Solving that one will open a hole in the glass at the back of the room.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        {{ ss("mpuzzle6") }}
        <p>
            I don't want to do this one. It's actually made way harder by virtue of not being
            able to see the other side. I'll just steal what the Wiki says.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Push right 5 times. Push left once. </li>
            <li>Push down 6 times. Push left 5 times. </li>
            <li>Push up 4 times. Push right once. </li>
            <li>Push up 4 times. Push down twice. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Thanks, Wiki editor, for that one.
        </p>

            When you go through the door, it'll spit you out at a fake exit. Go straight south to 
            find the terrain corrupting a bit; if you keep going, you'll find a door that leads to
            the top floor of the Mirage Tower. Here you can find the <em>Normalium-Z</em>, 
            <em>TM04 Calm Mind</em>, and a {{ sp("HONEDGE") }}. Once you exit, it'll take you
            all the way outside.
