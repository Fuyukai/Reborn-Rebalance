        Okay, actually, before going anywhere - we need to make a stop in front of the Grand Hall.
        Set the weather to Sunny and there will be an ice cream vendor down below the stairs
        to the Grand Hall. Buy a Chocolate Ice Cream from her, and continue up Opal Bridge towards
        the east-most piggy, where Victoria will be arguing with him to let us through. Sheldon
        Cooper will show up and successfully convince the piggy to let us through.
    </p>

    <p>
        We could advance the plot here... but fuck that! Let's do some exploring. First,
        ignore everything and beeline straight towards the candy shop with a Swirl on the
        outside (it's next to one of the piggies). There's a little girl standing next to the
        vending machine at the top right; talk to her and give her the chocolate ice cream
        you just bought to get her out of the way. Interact with the vending machine and select
        Vanilla to get a {{ sp("VANILLITE") }}.
    </p>

    <div class="notification is-info">
        As a side note; yes, that music does sound like the Magic Roundabout.
    </div>

    <p>
        Back-tracking a bit, go up the second alley from the left to a small area. On the right
        is the Pokémon Centre, and the daycare - but they're not letting you use it yet. We'll
        come back to that. On the left is two houses; the one closest to the alleyway has someone
        asking to trade their Castform for a Furret. Why you would want either of those is a mystery
        to me, but you can't do it anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, to the left and up is a house with a staircase down into the Obsidia side of the
        Underground Railnet. It's blocked off by a gate, and the switch is very inconveniently on
        the other side of it. Drat! However, there is one very valuable encounter here:
        {{ sp("KLINK") }}. Klink (and, by extension, {{ sp("KLINKLANG") }}) is one of the best
        Pokémon available purely because it is heavily helped out by the Factory Field, which is
        used in most Team Nazi encounters. Its signature moves (Gear Grind and Shift gear) are
        massively boosted up. Plus, Motor Drive and Levitate are two great abilities.
        <strong>I highly recommend you catch a Klink.</strong>
    </p>

    {{ ss("sheldoncooper") }}

    <p>
        Now, return to the right of Obsidia and talk to Sheldon Cooper to advance the plot forwards.
        She tells you that you will need Cut to go inside the park-turned-forest and stop Team Nazi
        from destroying the entire ward; you can get Cut from somebody called Amaria (one of my
        favourite characters in the game!) in the Coral Ward. The only problem: the Coral Ward is
        blocked off! There's a cuttable tree above the right path, and the indirect route has
        the road completely destroyed. We're going to have to go around. Your only route is
        through the Obsidia Slums, which is available through a narrow alleyway at the southwest
        of the map.
    </p>

    <a href="#obsidia-slums" id="obsidia-slums"><h2 class="subtitle">Obsidia Slums</h2></a>

    {{ ss("slums1") }}

    <p>
        This is a long and winding dungeon, where the route isn't immediately obvious. To your
        left is a bin with a single <em>Potion</em> in it. To the left is a fence, and behind that
        fence is an Egg! You can't get to it yet, though. Your only option is to go upwards. Carry
        on straight left and go straight up to find... an elevator door! It's locked. There's a gate
        next to it blocking off access to the upper part of the slum. Again, your only option here
        is to go left. Next to the guy running in place is a hidden Pokésnax (damn, that would've
        been useful an hour ago!)
    </p>

    <p>
        Further left, there's another elevator door blocked by guy, and a <em>Light Shard</em>.
        These are special shards that fully restore your team when interacted with, and are usually
        put right before an important story trainer. Heal your team using it, and then continue
        upwards to meet with Victoria! She'll challenge you to a fight. This can be a tricky fight;
        I wiped out to her twice in a row in my first playthrough. Here's some tips:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            All her Pokémon have boosting moves in their moveset. If they get to +3 or +4, it's
            over; so consider resetting and catching something else to slot in.
        </li>
        <li>
            Again, Growth Roselia (now with Mega Drain) muscles straight through her team at +1, with
            the exception of Torracat.
        </li>
    </ul>

    {{ trainer_battle_content("Victoria", "Victoria", 21) }}

    <p>
        After beating her, an observer to the left makes some misogynistic comments before being
        bullied into opening the gate up above you. If you wish, you can go down the broken
        escalator to a small subsection of B1F, where a <em>Great Ball</em> will be waiting on the
        floor for you. You can also catch a {{ sp("PANCHAM") }} here - a great earlygame Pokémon.
        In my first run, I found Pancham/Pangoro helped out a lot with some trickier sections. This
        subsection is cut off from the rest of the basement, however, so go back up and through the
        entrance now exposed by the open gate.
    </p>

    {{ ss("slums2") }}

    <p>
        And now we come to a true staple of Pokémon Reborn. This one small feature is what this
        game is really known for. It's one of the most pervasive design decisions in the game,
        and dramatically affects every part of it, from the story, to the difficulty, to the level
        design. Countless Reborn players have banged their head on the wall in frustration,
        seemingly being softlocked with no possible way forward - no matter how hard they try. This
        is in my mind, what Pokémon Reborn is all about. No, I don't mean the field effects; I mean
        the fucking jumping puzzles. They have a few "simple" rules:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            You can either move exactly one tile along the two axis, or jump exactly two tiles along
            the two axis.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can't jump through obstacles. (Duh.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Some platforms are wobbly, which causes you to stop in place for a second. (Later on
            it has other effects, but not here in the Slums).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The solution here is really simple; jump down once, move to the left, jump down twice.
        Great! Keep going along for a trainer guarding a hidden Rawst Berry in the topmost rock,
        and then go through the door to continue. In the next room, if you continue straight
        downwards, a crate will skedaddle away!
    </p>

    {{ ss("slums2_arrows") }}

    <p>
        On the other hand, immediately to the left is another jumping puzzle. You want to follow
        that first. There are two possible routes; the red arrow route and the blue arrow route. The blue arrow route leads
        to a hidden Extra-Small Exp Candy in the box to the right but nothing else. The red arrow
        route leads to the same room as the blue arrow route, but you can jump straight across to
        find a <em>Moon Stone</em>, and an entrance to another floor. Go through it for a small
        cutscene with Sephiroth the Moral Doctor; you can steal some
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1iCZpFMYd0">Zinc</a> from his office, and a small
        Exp Candy from the conspicuous area behind a fence at the bottom of the room. Besides
        that, there's nothing really of value in this area.
    </p>

    <p>
        Go back across the jumping puzzle and down where the moving crate went. You'll exit out onto
        the roof of the Slums, with a light shard nearby. Take it to heal your team, and re-enter
        the Slums to find a corridor; the left side has a TM but is blocked off. The right side has
        a lift door constantly opeening and closing; you can enter it to find a Mankey fiddling with
        the controls. Interact with it and it'll skedaddle, letting you interact with the lift.
        You can go down to floor 1, which will unlock the mysterious blocked off door next to
        the gate, but not much else; so go down to floor B1F.
    </p>

    {{ ss("slums3") }}

    <p>
        This floor is a bit of a bastard to navigate due to all the debris. First of all,
        at the far left side of the room is another lift door. Interact with it to have another
        crate scurry away, and then enter it to access both the TM60 on floor 2F and a Net Ball
        behind the youngster previously blocking you on floor 1F. (Make sure to talk to him
        as well, he'll move out of the way and let you access the lift freely.)
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, travel upwards into the big void door in the centre of the room. Inside is a light
        shard, the crate that keeps running away, and a single trainer to fight. (Use the light
        shard after you fight the trainer.) Navigating through the debris and floor cracks,
        you'll find a door at the very top... and then a fight with the source of the moving
        crates: a gang of Scraggy!
    </p>

    {{ trainer_battle_content("Gang", "Pokemon", 0) }}

    <p>
        You can then pass through a gate onto the left side of the previous building, which lets
        you out into the right-most half of B1F. Before going up the the escalator to floor 1F
        again, travel through the right side of the screen here. Yes, that's a door!
    </p>

    {{ ss("slums4") }}

    <p>
        If you travel through these rooms, you will find... your way blocked off by two smashable
        rocks! You can talk to the trainer for some lore; there's a Pokémon that comes through here
        occasionally, but only when it smells food. You can't go through the door, but if you could,
        it would lead you to another (and the coolest section of) the Underground Railnet. Make a
        mental or physical note of this for later, as we'll want to come back to the slums several
        times.
    </p>

    <p>
        Return back to the escalator and go up it to access the right side of the Slums. Go down and talk to
        the guy nearest the gate and he'll open it up so that you don't have to go the long way
        around next time. Before going up, immediately to your left is another "hidden" doorway
        that you should go through... and another jumping puzzle! This one is a bit annoying as you
        can't easily see the lower platforms, but you can follow this route:
    </p>

    {{ ss("slums5_arrows") }}

    <p>
        Go down the path from the puzzle and down into the previously fenced off corridor that was
        inaccessible from the main entrance. At the bottom is an <strong>Egg</strong>! This egg
        contains one of three Pokémon, determined either at random or by certain monotype passwords
        entered at the start of the game:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Ducklett, for water or flying
        </li>
        <li>
            Bronzor, for steel, monowoke, or psychic
        </li>
        <li>
            Drowzee, for psychic
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Pick up your egg and head back to the gate room, then up from the gate to the right-most
        exit of the slums. With that, you can head down to the pathway to the Coral Ward!
